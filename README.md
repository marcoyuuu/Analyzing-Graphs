# Analyzing-Graphs
This program finds the topological order, possible cycles, and connected components of a mathematical graph. The graphs are given through “.txt” files. I used the "Depth-First Search" (DFS) algorithm to obtain the topological order and the possible cycles, since the DFS explains how the vertices of a graph are traversed and gives them initialization and finalization times. With these times, it is possible to find trailing edges and, therefore, possible cycles. To find the connected components, I used the “Breadth-First Search” (BFS) algorithm to discern how many separate subgraphs the given graph has.
